# Detecting gravitational lenses using machine learning: exploring interpretability and sensitivity to rare lensing configuration
This repository contains the CNN architectures and weights, and the code used to train and test these CNN models [1]. The code used to generate gravitational compound lenses are also included [1]. The interpretability code in this paper is adapted from [2].
