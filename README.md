# Detecting gravitational lenses using machine learning: exploring interpretability and sensitivity to rare lensing configuration
This repository contains the CNN architectures and weights, and the code used to train and test these CNN models [1]. The code used to generate gravitational compound lenses are also included [1]. The interpretability code in this paper is adapted from [2]. 


## CNN Models
This paper uses 7 CNN models, these models use two basic architectures (OU-66 and OU-200) with varing number of input bands. The models OU-J, OU-Y, OU-H, OU-JYH, and OU-66 use the OU-66 architecture, and OU-VIS and OU-200 use the OU-200 architecture.

## Gravitational Compound Lenses
To investigate if these models can identify gravitational compound lenses, we needed to simulate these images. This was achieved
